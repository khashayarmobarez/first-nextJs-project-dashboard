// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

// arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

// arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]


function arrayDiff(a, b) {

  let result = [...a]

  b.map(num => result.filter(numb => numb === num))
  
}



// Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

// Example:

// Given an input string of:

// apples, pears # and bananas
// grapes
// bananas !apples
// The output expected would be:

// apples, pears
// grapes
// bananas
// The code would be called like so:

var result = solution("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", ["#", "!"])
// result should == "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas"
